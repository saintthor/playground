# UI Improvements Completion Summary

## Completion Date
January 27, 2025

## Fixed Bugs

### 1. Network Graph Display Issue âœ…
- **Problem**: The network graph only showed nodes, without any connection lines.
- **Solution**: Added logic for generating and drawing connection lines in the D3.js rendering.
- **File Modified**: `src/ui/MainPanel.js`

### 2. UI Redraw Performance Issue âœ…
- **Problem**: The user area and blockchain blocks were constantly being fully redrawn.
- **Solution**: Implemented incremental updates to only update elements that have changed.
- **File Modified**: `src/ui/MainPanel.js`

### 3. Log Display Order Issue âœ…
- **Problem**: New logs were displayed at the top, leading to a confusing order.
- **Solution**: Changed it so new logs are appended to the bottom, with auto-scrolling.
- **File Modified**: `src/ui/LogPanel.js`

### 4. Log Style Issue âœ…
- **Problem**: The log background color was too dark, and the timestamp took up a separate line.
- **Solution**: Used a lighter background color and displayed the timestamp and message on the same line.
- **Files Modified**: `src/ui/LogPanel.js`, `src/styles/main.css`
