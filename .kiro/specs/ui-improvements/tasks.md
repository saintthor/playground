# UI Improvement Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix Network Graph Display Issues
  - Fix the issue where the network graph only shows nodes without connections.
  - Implement the logic for drawing connection lines between nodes.
  - Control the number and status of connections based on network parameters.
  - Use different colors to represent active/faulty connections.
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 2. Implement Incremental UI Update Optimization
  - Fix the issue of continuous redrawing in the user area and blockchain blocks.
  - Implement updating only the user/blockchain cards that have changed.
  - Avoid unnecessary DOM operations and repeated binding of event listeners.
  - Optimize rendering performance by reducing global repaints.
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [x] 3. Fix Log Display Order and Style Issues
  - Fix the reversed log order; new logs should be at the bottom.
  - Modify the log-adding logic to use the correct chronological order.
  - Implement auto-scrolling to the latest log.
  - Fix the issue of the log background color being too dark.
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4_

- [x] 4. Optimize Log Layout and Display
  - Fix the issue of the log timestamp occupying a separate line.
  - Implement displaying the timestamp and message on the same line.
  - Reduce the vertical height of each log entry.
  - Use a lighter background color for better readability.
  - _Requirements: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4_

- [x] 5. Create a Test Page to Verify Fixes
  - Create a UI fix test page.
  - Implement automated testing functionality.
  - Verify that all fixes are working correctly.
  - Ensure the interface is responsive and smooth.
  - _Requirements: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4_

- [x] 6. Fix Hash Value Validation Floating Window
  - Implement displaying a floating window on mouse hover.
  - The window should contain the full hash value and validation code.
  - The window should hide when the mouse leaves the area.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 7. Fix Validation Code Copy Functionality
  - Fix the copy functionality of the "Copy Code" button.
  - Fix the copy functionality of the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
  - Add feedback messages for successful/failed copy operations.
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 8. Fix SHA256 Hash Value Display Issues
  - Ensure the correct SHA256 algorithm is used.
  - Display the full 64-character hexadecimal string.
  - Provide detailed information about the hash calculation.
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 9. Redesign the Main Panel Layout
  - Place the user area below the P2P network graph.
  - Remove DOM elements above the network graph that take up vertical space.
  - Expand the network graph width to 100%.
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 10. Fix Incomplete Node Display in Network Graph
  - Ensure the network graph displays all configured nodes.
  - Use an appropriate layout algorithm to ensure all nodes are visible.
  - Provide zoom or scroll functionality.
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
