# MainPanel Fix Summary

## 🐛 Problem Diagnosis

**Error**: `Uncaught ReferenceError: MainPanel is not defined`

**Root Cause**: A syntax error existed in the `src/ui/MainPanel.js` file, which prevented the JavaScript engine from parsing the file. As a result, the `MainPanel` class was never defined.

## 🔍 Locating the Issue

The error was identified using Node.js syntax checking:
```bash
node -c src/ui/MainPanel.js
```

Error Message:
```
/home/thor/Projects/AOBPlayground/src/ui/MainPanel.js:100
renderNetworkGraph(container, networkData) {
^
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'
```

## 🛠️ The Fix

### Problematic Code (Lines 95-105):
```javascript
            chainCount.textContent = data.chainData ? data.chainData.size : 0;
        }
    }
}    // ← An extra } here terminated the class definition prematurely

    renderNetworkGraph(container, networkData) { // ← This became a global function, causing a syntax error
```

### Corrected Code:
```javascript
            chainCount.textContent = data.chainData ? data.chainData.size : 0;
        }
    }
    
    renderNetworkGraph(container, networkData) { // ← Now correctly a class method
```

## ✅ Results of the Fix

1.  **Syntax Check Passes**:
    ```bash
    node -c src/ui/MainPanel.js
    # Exit Code: 0 (Success)
    ```

2.  **`MainPanel` Class is Correctly Defined**:
    - The class can now be instantiated normally.
    - All methods are within the class scope.
    - The script no longer throws an error upon loading.

## 🧪 Verification Method

A test file, `debug-mainpanel.html`, was created to verify the fix:
- ✅ The `MainPanel` class is correctly defined.
- ✅ An instance of `MainPanel` can be created successfully.
- ✅ There are no more syntax errors.

## 📁 Modified Files

1.  **src/ui/MainPanel.js** - Fixed the extra `}` character on line 99.
2.  **debug-mainpanel.html** - Created a debug test file.

## 🎯 Final Status

The `MainPanel` class is now correctly defined, and the application can start without the "MainPanel is not defined" error.

All previously fixed features (floating verification window, control panel auto-hide, hash formatting, etc.) should now work as expected.
